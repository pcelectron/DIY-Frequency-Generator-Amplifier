# DIY-Frequency-Generator-Amplifier

This is a open source frequency generator amplifier capable of delivering up to 1.5 Amps and 28 Vpp at up to 100MHz. It is based on three THS3491 IC's in parallel. The gain of the amplifier stage is fixed at 2, but can be changed by changing the feedback network resistors.
This Repo has the Kicad project files, gerbers, BOM and 3d models of the board and case. Please make a pull request if you have imporvements, which you find to be useful for others.
